## About  
In the Internet, you can often find sites where you need to answer some questions. It can be educational sites, sites with psychological tests, job search services, or just entertaining sites like web quests. The common thing for them is the ability to answer questions (or quizzes) and then see some results. In this project, you will create a complex web service and learn about REST API, an embedded database, security, and other technologies. If you would like to continue the project, you could develop a web or mobile client for this web service on your own. 

This project allows you to practice and strengthen your coding skills, helping you get ready for more advanced tasks ahead.

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your track to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:
